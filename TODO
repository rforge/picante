TODO list for picante package

General notes: Many functions are untested or outright broken. Do not use any of these functions for 'real' analysis without getting in touch with a project developer first.

TODO
====
For 0.1
-------
-fix trait data input - currently most functions expect a vector with names, should handle/check lack of names and allow data.frames (single or multiple columns).
-fix null models - most assume presence-absence data but don't check
-standardize use of null model functions (combine all into one function)
-standardize species distance metrics (combine all into one function)
-clean up/hide utility functions

For 0.2
-------
-implement null model heavy lifting in C code - see BB's email for a start
-implement contrib index and similar
-qr on comdist as option
-trait gradient analysis and contrast diagnostics functions from DDA
