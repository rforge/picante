TODO list for picante package
====
-data name checking and matching - currently many functions expect data to have names that match e.g. phylo$tip.labels, should handle/check lack of names and warn. Write helper function.
-reinstate function to call out to phylocom executable and read results back in to R
-allow trait data to be a vector or a data.frame (single or multiple columns)
-implement contribution index, nodesig, and similar node-based statistics from phylocom
-work with phylobase/xml format trees/data
-trait gradient analysis and contrast diagnostics functions from DDA
-taxaShuffle and comstruct functions - rewrite to use indices in place of names for efficiency
-vignettes
