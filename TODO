TODO list for picante package

General notes: Many functions are untested. Do not use any of these functions for 'real' analysis without getting in touch with a project developer first.

TODO
====
For 0.1
-------
-fix trait data input - currently most functions expect a vector with names, should handle/check lack of names and warn. Write helper function.
-merge community structure and phylocom functions into one file
-add data files for example purposes (phylocom sample, traits, phylo)
-improve documentation especially for ses.mpd, ses.mnnd, phylosignal, ?

For 0.2
-------
-reinstate function to call out to phylocom executable and read results back in to R
-implement null model heavy lifting in C code - see BB's email for a start
-allow trait data to be a vector or a data.frame (single or multiple columns)
-implement contrib index and similar - move to phylobase format?
-qr on comdist as option
-trait gradient analysis and contrast diagnostics functions from DDA
-taxaShuffle and comstruct functions - rewrite to use indices in place of names for efficiency
-vignettes
