TODO list for picante package

General notes: Many functions are untested. Do not use any of these functions for 'real' analysis without getting in touch with a project developer first.

TODO
====
For 0.1
-------
-improve documentation for public release
-data name checking and matching - currently many functions expect data to have names that match e.g. phylo$tip.labels, should handle/check lack of names and warn. Write helper function.

For 0.2 and beyond
-------
-reinstate function to call out to phylocom executable and read results back in to R
-implement null model heavy lifting in C code - see BB's email for a start
-allow trait data to be a vector or a data.frame (single or multiple columns)
-implement contrib index and similar
-move to phylobase format
-qr on com.phylo.corr as option
-trait gradient analysis and contrast diagnostics functions from DDA
-taxaShuffle and comstruct functions - rewrite to use indices in place of names for efficiency
-vignettes
